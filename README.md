# Flight-Delays-Analysis( Interactive Dashboard Creation Using PowerBI)
This project analyzes flight delays in the US using Power BI. The dataset used is DelayedFlights, and the project demonstrates data cleaning, modeling, and visualization techniques to uncover insights into flight delays and airline performance.

# Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning – Performed in Power BI.
- Data Modeling – Created Star Schema with Fact & Dimension tables.
- DAX Measures & Columns – Built measures (Avg ArrDelay, Avg DepDelay, etc.) and calculated columns to classify flights (On Time, Late, Early).
